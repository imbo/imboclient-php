.. _Installation:

Installation
============

The recommended way to install ImboClient is with `Composer <http://getcomposer.org/>`_. If you do not have Composer installed you need to do this first:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

When this is done you can add ImboClient as a dependency to your project:

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require imbo/imboclient:^3.0

After installation you need to require the autoloader generated by Composer:

.. code-block:: php

    require 'vendor/autoload.php';

All available versions can be located at `packagist <https://packagist.org/packages/imbo/imboclient>`_.

Guidelines
----------

1. ImboClient adheres to the `Imbo coding standard <https://github.com/imbo/imbo-coding-standard>`_. The `PHP Coding Standards Fixer <https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer>`_ tool is used to enforce this.
2. The minimum PHP version requirement is ``7.4``.
3. All changes / new features must include unit tests.

Running checks locally
----------------------

Before pushing code you might want to run the CI checks locally to make sure your pull request does not fail. This can be done by running a composer script after you have installed all dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Clone the repository
    git clone git@github.com:imbo/imboclient-php.git && cd imboclient-php

    # Install dependencies
    composer install

    # Run script that will execute the different checks
    composer run ci

You can also run the different checks separately:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run unit tests
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit

    # Run static code analysis
    ./vendor/bin/psalm

    # Check coding standard
    php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run --diff

The last check requires a local installation of `PHP Coding Standards Fixer <https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer>`_. The first two should be executable after a successful ``composer install``.
