ImboClient-0.4.1
----------------
__2012-03-21__

* Fixed bug with query params not being included when generating the access token. This bug broke get `getImages()` method in the client.

ImboClient-0.4.0
----------------
__2012-03-21__

This version of the client includes some backward compatibility breaks. The client now returns different implementations of `ImboClient\Url\UrlInterface` for the following methods in the client:

* `getUserUrl()`
* `getImagesUrl()`
* `getImageUrl()`
* `getMetadataUrl()`

All implementations can be used as strings so if your code mostly prints these out you are good to go.

The main reason for the BC breaks is a new feature that is to be implemented on the server that requires access tokens for all URLs. The way ImboClient-0.3.0 handles URLs made this feature less clean to implement. All URLs that is generated by the client now includes this access token, which is a keyed SHA256 hash using the private key.

Other changes include a change to the namespace of the class used when querying Imbo for images as well as the image instances returned from this query. They have both been changed from `ImboClient\ImagesQuery` to `ImboClient\Url\Images`.
